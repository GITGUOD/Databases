D9. The problems that can arise are conditions such as when multiple users check for seat availability, it might display
    a nbr of seats available. However, when they all book simutaneously, the server might not be able to handle that and the result
    of that is that they all booked seats even though there aren't that many seats available. Another problem that might arise is the
    server might suffer from not updating correct due to the high amount of active people that are booking, for instance the database
    could or might not be able to update all the bookings simutaneously, resulting in false numbers of available seats.

D10
   Some sort of transaction management which is the ability to execute a series of database operations as a single unit to ensure consistency
   and isolation when for instance the server is in the presence of multiple transactions.

   Different level of isolations that ensure that the system can candle the amount of acitivity going on, on the booking site.

   Some sort of durability, for instance the ACID properties that ensure the server in the presence of errors and crashes that the site
   should be able to handle exceptions.
